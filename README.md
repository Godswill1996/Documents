# Basic calculator v1

Created a file that print the summation handcoded figures

# Basic calculator  v2
 
After i created the file,it gave me error reason because it concatinated the figure
instead of giving me 30 it outputed 1020

# Basic calculator v3

I created another file to fix the errors by using float.
